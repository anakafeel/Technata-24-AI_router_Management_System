# Technata-24-AI_router_Management_System

Ecointelligence is an AI-driven router management system designed to reduce energy consumption in large IT hubs by predicting network traffic and dynamically powering down unused routers. The system uses two machine learning modelsâ€”a Linear Regression model to forecast bandwidth usage trends, and a Random Forest Regressor to determine router on/off states based on traffic patterns. The solution also repurposes heat generated by routers for cooling, optimizing overall energy efficiency. Built with a Next.js frontend and a RESTful API, Ecointelligence delivers real-time predictions through an interactive web dashboard, making it a scalable solution for reducing operational costs in tech-heavy environments.
